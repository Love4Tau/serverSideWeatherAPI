# serverSideWeatherAPI

## Description

In this project, I've put all the skills I've learned so far together (HTML, CSS, JS). Using an API and pulling nested values from an array was a lot of fun and it helped me become a little more comfortable with arrays and fetch calls. It was a little challenging re-creating the design provided and making it responsive. I used a lot of console logs to make sure I was pulling the correct data - I started console logging everything because I spent an hour creating my funvtion - I didn't know why it wasn't working until I checked the console and saw that the values I passed was undefined LOL. Local storage doesn't like me right now, so I avoided saving/pulling from local storage in this project. The design isn't anything eye catching but it works XD

## Credits

I relied heavily on the xpert AI for assistance figuring out how to create elements for objects in an array and appending that to my html element - I'm tired of local storage so I decided to go this route :D

I re-watched our Server Side API Day 3 cloud recording which helped so much

Still using/referring to stack overflow LOL. I ran into so many issues that I had to google/search through stack overflow forums for answers, haha!

https://web.dev/articles/fixing-mixed-content?hl=en - this error gave me a huge headache. I switched my urls in my js file from http to https but it would not reflect the new changes in the deployed website. I had to open an incognito window - saw that it worked in there. I ended up clearing the cache and cookies and my website worked!
